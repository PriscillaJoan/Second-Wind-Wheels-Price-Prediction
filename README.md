### Executive Summary:

As Data Scientists at `Second Wind Wheels`, a leading online used car retailer, we propose a project to develop a machine learning model for predicting the accurate market value of used cars. This model will revolutionize our pricing strategy, boosting profits and enhancing customer satisfaction.

**Problem Statement**:

Currently, used car pricing relies heavily on manual valuations by human appraisers. This method is prone to subjectivity, inconsistencies, and delays, leading to:
Overpricing: Cars priced too high stagnate on the lot, incurring storage costs and lost sales.

1. Underpricing: We miss out on maximizing profits by selling cars for less than their true market value.

2. Customer dissatisfaction: Unfairly priced cars may discourage buyers and damage brand reputation.

To address this business challenge, we will leverage Second Wind Wheels existing used car sales data along with additional data scraped from various automotive websites to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict used car prices.

## Data Pertinence & Attribution:
The model will be developed using up-to-date used car listing data scraped from major automotive sales sites to incorporate broader market pricing trends. It includes details on used car sales across the Japan.
